# ðŸ§  Card Prediction Model

This project is a **Card Prediction Model** built using machine learning and data science libraries in Python. It leverages the power of logistic regression and other statistical techniques to predict card-related outcomes based on input data.

## ðŸ“¦ Required Libraries

Before running the model, make sure the following libraries are installed:

- **pandas** â€“ for data manipulation and analysis  
- **numpy** â€“ for numerical operations  
- **seaborn** â€“ for data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** â€“ for building and evaluating ML models  
- **streamlit** â€“ for creating an interactive web interface  
- **pickle** â€“ for saving and loading trained models  
- **statsmodels** â€“ for statistical testing and model summaries  

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn streamlit statsmodels


### How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Train your model using the dataset.
3. Save the model using pickle.
4. Create a Streamlit app (app.py) to serve predictions.


**To run the Streamlit app:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
