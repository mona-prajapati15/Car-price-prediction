# 🧠 Car Prediction Model

This project is a **Car Prediction Model** built using machine learning and data science libraries in Python. It leverages the power of logistic regression and other statistical techniques to predict car-related outcomes based on input data.

## 📦 Required Libraries

Before running the model, make sure the following libraries are installed:

- **pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy** – for numerical operations
- **seaborn** – for data visualization
- **scikit-learn** – for building and evaluating ML models
- **streamlit** – for creating an interactive web interface
- **pickle** – for saving and loading trained models *(built-in module)*
- **statsmodels** – for statistical testing and model summaries

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn streamlit statsmodels
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Train your model using the dataset.
3. Save the trained model using pickle.
4. Create a Streamlit app (`app.py`) to serve predictions.
5. To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
